# Cribbed, an AwesomeWM extras repo

So I use [AwesomeWM](https://awesomewm.org).  It is, as the name implies,
great.  And there are a lot of fantastic plugins for it that are floating
around that I can't use *just as they are*.  So I fork em.  But then they need
all this extra finagling to get them to import correctly (maybe I just don't
know lua that well -- well actually definitely I don't know lua *all* that
well).

So I'm cribbing some widgets and writing some of my own.  They all live here.
I try to give credit where credit is due as much as possible; if one of the
authors listed in this repo aren't okay with what I'm doing, please [open an
issue][] and ask me to remove it.

The tricky part here is LICENSING: Awesome itself is under the [GPL 2][], so I
think most (if not all) derivative works also have to be.  So that's what
everything I have written is licensed under, and anything that I didn't write
all the way is licensed however it is (I'll list it if it's present and not
GPL'd).  Anyway, fun stuff.

[open an issue]: TODO

## So what's in here?

Okay, here's a list of what we have in this li'l crib:

- a fork of [pltanton/net_widgets](https://github.com/pltanton/net_widgets)
- a fork of
  [gvalkov/awesome-ezconfig](https://github.com/gvalkov/awesome-ezconfig)
- my own widgets:
    - little textboxes that report your `master_count` and `column_count`
      (more to come!)
    - a [Discordian calendar][] widget that uses `ddate`

That's all for now, folks!
